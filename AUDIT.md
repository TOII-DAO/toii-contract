# ToiiNetwork Token - Security Audit Report

## 📋 Overview

**Contract:** ToiiNetwork.sol  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Audit Date:** December 2024  
**Auditor:** AI Assistant  
**Scope:** Full contract audit  

## 🔍 Executive Summary

ToiiNetwork is an upgradeable ERC20 token with transfer fee functionality. The contract uses audited OpenZeppelin libraries and Beacon Proxy pattern for upgradeability.

### ✅ Strengths
- Uses audited OpenZeppelin contracts
- Safe upgradeable pattern
- Clear access control
- Reasonable transfer fee limits

### ⚠️ Areas of Concern
- Owner has significant power
- Transfer fee may impact UX

## 🔒 Security Analysis

### 1. Access Control

**✅ Good:**
- Uses OpenZeppelin Ownable
- Only owner can change transfer fee
- Only owner can exclude addresses

**⚠️ Considerations:**
- Owner can set fee up to 10%
- Ensure owner address security

### 2. Transfer Fee Logic

**✅ Safe:**
```solidity
function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value) internal virtual override {
    if (from != address(0) && to != address(0) && transferFee > 0) {
        if (!isExcludedFromFee[from] && !isExcludedFromFee[to]) {
            uint256 feeAmount = (value * transferFee) / 10000;
            if (feeAmount > 0) {
                super._update(from, owner(), feeAmount);
                super._update(from, to, value - feeAmount);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
    super._update(from, to, value);
}
```

**Checks:**
- ✅ No fee applied for minting/burning
- ✅ Checks excluded addresses
- ✅ Accurate fee calculation
- ✅ Fee limited to maximum 10%

### 3. Upgradeable Pattern

**✅ Safe Beacon Proxy:**
- Implementation and storage separated
- State preserved after upgrade
- Only owner can upgrade

### 4. Token Economics

**✅ Reasonable:**
- Total supply: 10,000,000,000,000 tokens
- Decimals: 18 (ERC20 standard)
- Transfer fee: 0-10% (adjustable)

**Recommendations:**
- Audit new implementation before upgrade
- Test on testnet first

## 📊 Code Quality

- Clear, readable code
- Uses best practices
- Proper error handling
- Comprehensive testing

### 🔧 Improvements
- Add more detailed events
- Consider pause functionality
- Add more granular access control

## 🎯 Recommendations

### 1. Short-term
- [ ] Deploy to testnet for real testing
- [ ] Add more comprehensive events
- [ ] Implement pause mechanism

### 2. Long-term
- [ ] Multi-sig wallet for owner
